> **Tutorial Link**: [https://flyeric.top/archives/claude-3.5-vs-3.7-code-comparison](https://flyeric.top/archives/claude-3.5-vs-3.7-code-comparison)

This repository contains a comparison of frontend programming capabilities between Claude 3.5 and Claude 3.7 AI models in the Cursor editor environment. The project aims to evaluate and showcase the differences in code generation, problem-solving approaches, and overall effectiveness of these AI models in frontend development tasks.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into two main directories:

- `claude3.5/` - Contains code generated by Claude 3.5
- `claude3.7/` - Contains code generated by Claude 3.7

## Test Categories

Each AI model was tested on three different frontend development tasks:

### 1. Frontend Replication
Recreating the Cursor official website UI from screenshots, testing the AI's ability to translate visual designs into functional code.
